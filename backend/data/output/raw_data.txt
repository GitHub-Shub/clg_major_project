ASSGNMENT OR TRANSFER OF POLICIES AND NOMINATIONS
1[38. Assignment and transfer of insurance policies. -(1) A transfer or assignment of a policy of
insurance, wholly or in part, whether with or without consideration, may be made only by an endorsement
upon the policy itself or by a separate instrument, signed in either case by the transferor or by the assignor
or his duly authorised agent and attested by at least one witness, specifically setting forth the fact of
transfer or assignment and the reasons thereof, the antecedents of the assignee and the terms on which the
assignment is made.
(2) An insurer may, accept the transfer or assignment, or decline to act upon any endorsement made
under sub-section (1), where it has sufficient reason to believe that such transfer or assignment is not
bona fide or is not in the interest of the policyholder or in public interest or is for the purpose of trading of
insurance policy.
(3) The insurer shall, before refusing to act upon the endorsement, record in writing the reasons for
such refusal and communicate the same to the policyholder not later than thirty days from the date of the
policyholder giving notice of such transfer or assignment.
(4) Any person aggrieved by the decision of an insurer to decline to act upon such transfer or
assignment may within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the communication from the
insurer containing reasons for such refusal, prefer a claim to the Authority.
(5) Subject to the provisions in sub-section (2), the transfer or assignment shall be complete and
effectual upon the execution of such endorsement or instrument duly attested but except, where the
transfer or assignment is in favour of the insurer, shall not be operative as against an insurer, and shall not
confer upon the transferee or assignee, or his legal representative, any right to sue for the amount of such
1. Subs. by Act 5 of 2015, s. 45, for sections 38, 39 and 40 (w.e.f. 26-12-2014).
policy or the moneys secured thereby until a notice in writing of the transfer or assignment and either the
said endorsement or instrument itself or a copy thereof certified to be correct by both transferor and
transferee or their duly authorised agents have been delivered to the insurer:
Provided that where the insurer maintains one or more places of business in India, such notice shall
be delivered only at the place where the policy is being serviced.
(6) The date on which the notice referred to in sub-section (5) is delivered to the insurer shall regulate
the priority of all claims under a transfer or assignment as between persons interested in the policy; and
where there is more than one instrument of transfer or assignment the priority of the claims under such
instruments shall be governed by the order in which the notices referred to in sub-section (5) are
delivered:
Provided that if any dispute as to priority of payment arises as between assignees, the dispute shall be
referred to the Authority.
(7) Upon the receipt of the notice referred to in sub-section (5), the insurer shall record the fact of
such transfer or assignment together with the date thereof and the name of the transferee or the assignee
and shall, on the request of the person by whom the notice was given, or of the transferee or assignee, on
payment of such fee as may be specified by the regulations, grant a written acknowledgement of the
receipt of such notice; and any such acknowledgement shall be conclusive evidence against the insurer
that he has duly received the notice to which such acknowledgement relates.
(8) Subject to the terms and conditions of the transfer or assignment, the insurer shall, from the date
of the receipt of the notice referred to in sub-section (5), recognise the transferee or assignee named in the
notice as the absolute transferee or assignee entitled to benefit under the policy, and such person shall be
subject to all liabilities and equities to which the transferor or assignor was subject at the date of the
transfer or assignment and may institute any proceedings in relation to the policy, obtain a loan under the
policy or surrender the policy without obtaining the consent of the transferor or assignor or making him a
party to such proceedings.
Explanation.- Except where the endorsement referred to in sub-section (1) expressly indicates that
the assignment or transfer is conditional in terms of sub-section (10) hereunder, every assignment or
transfer shall be deemed to be an absolute assignment or transfer and the assignee or transferee, as the
case may be, shall be deemed to be the absolute assignee or transferee respectively.
(9) Any rights and remedies of an assignee or transferee of a policy of life insurance under an
assignment or transfer effected prior to the commencement of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act,
2015 (5 of 2015) shall not be affected by the provisions of this section.
(10) Notwithstanding any law or custom having the force of law to the contrary, an assignment in
favour of a person made upon the condition that-
(a) the proceeds under the policy shall become payable to the policyholder or the nominee or
nominees in the event of either the assignee or transferee predeceasing the insured; or
(b) the insured surviving the term of the policy, shall be valid:
Provided that a conditional assignee shall not be entitled to obtain a loan on the policy or surrender a
policy.
(11) In the case of the partial assignment or transfer of a policy of insurance under sub-section (1), the
liability of the insurer shall be limited to the amount secured by partial assignment or transfer and such
policyholder shall not be entitled to further assign or transfer the residual amount payable under the same
policy.
39. Nomination by policyholder. -(1) The holder of a policy of life insurance on his own life may,
when effecting the policy or at any time before the policy matures for payment, nominate the person or
persons to whom the money secured by the policy shall be paid in the event of his death:
Provided that, where any nominee is a minor, it shall be lawful for the policyholder to appoint any
person in the manner laid down by the insurer, to receive the money secured by the policy in the event of
his death during the minority of the nominee.
(2) Any such nomination in order to be effectual shall, unless it is incorporated in the text of the
policy itself, be made by an endorsement on the policy communicated to the insurer and registered by him
in the records relating to the policy and any such nomination may at any time before the policy matures
for payment be cancelled or changed by an endorsement or a further endorsement or a will, as the case
may be, but unless notice in writing of any such cancellation or change has been delivered to the insurer,
the insurer shall not be liable for any payment under the policy made bona fide by him to a nominee
mentioned in the text of the policy or registered in records of the insurer.
(3) The insurer shall furnish to the policyholder a written acknowledgement of having registered a
nomination or a cancellation or change thereof, and may charge such fee as may be specified by
regulations for registering such cancellation or change.
(4) A transfer or assignment of a policy made in accordance with section 38 shall automatically
cancel a nomination:
Provided that the assignment of a policy to the insurer who bears the risk on the policy at the time of
the assignment, in consideration of a loan granted by that insurer on the security of the policy within its
surrender value, or its reassignment on repayment of the loan shall not cancel a nomination, but shall
affect the rights of the nominee only to the extent of the insurer’s interest in the policy:
Provided further that the transfer or assignment of a policy, whether wholly or in part, in
consideration of a loan advanced by the transferee or assignee to the policyholder, shall not cancel the
nomination but shall affect the rights of the nominee only to the extent of the interest of the transferee or
assignee, as the case may be, in the policy:
Provided also that the nomination, which has been automatically cancelled consequent upon the
transfer or assignment, the same nomination shall stand automatically revived when the policy is
reassigned by the assignee or retransferred by the transferee in favour of the policyholder on repayment of
loan other than on a security of policy to the insurer.
(5) Where the policy matures for payment during the lifetime of the person whose life is insured or
where the nominee or, if there are more nominees than one, all the nominees die before the policy
matures for payment, the amount secured by the policy shall be payable to the policyholder or his heirs or
legal representatives or the holder of a succession certificate, as the case may be.
(6) Where the nominee or if there are more nominees than one, a nominee or nominees survive the
person whose life is insured, the amount secured by the policy shall be payable to such survivor or
survivors.
(7) Subject to the other provisions of this section, where the holder of a policy of insurance on his
own life nominates his parents, or his spouse, or his children, or his spouse and children, or any of them,

transfer was made (in this section referred to as the principal company) then, if the principal company is
being wound up by 1*** , the 2[Tribunal] shall (subject as hereinafter mentioned) order the secondary
company to be wound up in conjunction with the principal company and may by the same or any
subsequent order appoint the same person to be liquidator for the two companies and make provision for
such other matters as may seem to the 2[Tribunal] necessary with a view to the companies being wound
up as if they were one company.

by the 2[Tribunal], be the commencement of the winding up of the secondary company.

of different classes of contributories in the case of winding up of a single company or as near thereto as
circumstances admit.
(4) Where any company alleged to be secondary is not in process of being wound up at the same time
as the principal company to which it is alleged to be secondary, the 2[Tribunal] shall not direct the
secondary company to be wound up, unless, after hearing all objections (if any) that may be urged by or
on behalf of the company against its being wound up, the 2[Tribunal] is of opinion that the company is
secondary to the principal company and that the winding up of the company in conjunction with the
principal company is just and equitable.
(5) An application may be made in relation to the winding up of any secondary company in
conjunction with the principal company by any creditor of, or person interested in, the principal or
secondary company.

the relation of a secondary company to some other insurance company or where there are several

most expedient upon the principles laid down in this section.

expedient that the affairs of an insurance company in respect of any class of business comprised in the
undertaking of the company should be wound up but that any other class of business comprised the
undertaking should continue to be carried on by the company or be transferred to another insurer, a
scheme for such purposes may be prepared and submitted for confirmation of the 3[Tribunal] in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2) Any scheme prepared under this section shall provide for the allocation and distribution of the
assets and liabilities of the company between any classes of business affected (including the allocation of
any surplus assets which may arise on the proposed winding up), for any future rights of every class of
policy-holders in respect of their policies and for the manner of winding up any of the affairs of the
company which are proposed to be wound up and may contain provisions for altering the memorandum
of the company with respect to its objects and such further provisions as may be expedient for giving
effect to the scheme.
(3) The provisions of this Act relating to the valuation of liabilities of insurers in liquidation and
insolvency and to the application of surplus assets of the life insurance fund in liquidation or insolvency
shall apply to the winding up of any part of the affairs of a company in accordance with the scheme under
this section in like manner as they apply in the winding up of an insurance company, and any scheme

to which he would have been subject but for the provisions of this sub-section.

policy of insurance it is not practicable for an insurer to employ an approved surveyor or loss assessor
without incurring expenses disproportionate to the amount of the claim, the insurer may employ any other
person (not being a person disqualified for the time being for being employed as a surveyor or loss
assessor) for surveying such loss and may pay such reasonable fee or remuneration to the person so
employed as he may think fit.
(9) The Authority may in respect of any claim of value of less than the amount specified in
sub-section (4) on an insurance policy, if the claim has not been or is not proposed to be reported upon by

assessor and where the Authority makes such direction, the provisions of sub-sections (5) and (6) shall
apply in respect of such claim.

manager of the company’s business or undertaking being duly appointed, or of possession being taken
by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by a floating charge of any property
comprised in or subject to the charge,
if, either before or after that event, any such liability is incurred by the insured person his rights against
the insurer under the contract in respect of the liability shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
any provision of law, be transferred to and vest in the third party to whom the liability was so incurred.
(2) Where an order for the administration of the estate of a deceased debtor is made according to the

liability to a third party against which he was insured under a contract of insurance in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter, the deceased debtor’s rights against the insurer in respect of that liability shall,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any provision of law, be transferred to and vest in the person
to whom the debt is owing.

insured person of any of the events specified in clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) or upon the
making of an order for the administration of the estate of a deceased debtor according to the law of
insolvency, shall be of no effect.
(4) Upon a transfer under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the insurer shall be under the same

the third party, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights of the insured person against the insurer
in respect of the excess amount; and
(b) if the liability of the insurer to the insured person is less than the liability of the insured person
to the third party, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights of the third party against the insured
person in respect of the balance amount.

behalf of the person making the claim, refuse to state whether or not he was insured in respect of that
liability by any policy issued under the provisions of this Chapter, or would have been so insured if the

business or undertaking being duly appointed or of possession being taken by or on behalf of the holders
of any debentures secured by a floating charge on any property comprised in or subject to the charge, it
shall be the duty of the insolvent debtor, personal representative of the deceased debtor or company, as
the case may be, or the official assignee or receiver in insolvency, trustee, liquidator, receiver or manager,
or person in possession of the property to give, on the request of any person claiming that the insolvent
debtor, deceased debtor or company is under such liability to him as is covered by the provision of this
Chapter, such information as may reasonably be required by him for the purpose of ascertaining whether
any rights have been transferred to and vested in him by section 151 and for the purpose of enforcing such
rights, if any, and any such contract of insurance as purports whether directly or indirectly to avoid the
contract or to alter the rights of the parties thereunder upon the giving of such information in the events
aforesaid, or otherwise to prohibit or prevent the giving thereof in the said events, shall be of no effect.
(3) If, from the information given to any person in pursuance of sub-section (2) or otherwise, he has
reasonable ground for supporting that there have or may have been transferred to him under this Chapter
rights against any particular insurer, that insurer shall be subject to the same duty as is imposed by the
said sub-section on the persons therein mentioned.
(4) The duty to give the information imposed by this section shall include a duty to allow all contracts
of insurance, receipts for premiums, and other relevant documents in the possession or power of the
person on whom the duty is so imposed to be inspected and copies thereof to be taken.

respect of any claim which might be made by a third party in respect of any liability of the nature referred
to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 147 shall be valid unless such third party is a party to the

influence and the compensation is made in accordance with the payment schedule referred to in
sub-section (1) of section 164.

insolvent, or where, if such insured person is a company, a winding-up order has been made or a
resolution for a voluntary winding-up has been passed with respect to the company, no agreement made
between the insurer and the insured person after the liability has been incurred to a third party and after
the commencement of the insolvency or winding-up, as the case may be, nor any waiver, assignment or
other disposition made by or payment made to the insured person after the commencement aforesaid,
shall be effective to defeat the rights transferred to the third party under this Chapter; but those rights
shall be the same as if no such agreement, waiver, assignment or disposition or payment has been made.
154. Saving in respect of sections 151, 152 and 153. - (1) For the purposes of sections 151, 152
and 153, a reference to “liabilities to third parties” in relation to a person insured under any policy of
insurance shall not include a reference to any liability of that person in the capacity of insurer under some
other policy of insurance.

of insurance had been issued, if it occurs after the happening of an event which has given rise to a claim
under the provisions of this Chapter, shall not be a bar to the survival of any cause of action arising out of
such event against his estate or against the insurer.

the insured, the insurer shall, as between himself and any other person except the insured, be deemed
to have issued to the insured person a policy of insurance conforming in all respects with the
description and particulars stated in such certificate; and
(b) if the insurer has issued to the insured the policy described in the certificate, but the actual
terms of the policy are less favourable to persons claiming under or by virtue of the policy against the
insurer either directly or through the insured than the particulars of the policy as stated in the
certificate, the policy shall, as between the insurer and any other person except the insured, be
deemed to be in terms conforming in all respects with the particulars stated in the said certificate.
157. Transfer of certificate of insurance. - (1) Where a person, in whose favour the certificate of

deemed to have been transferred in favour of the person to whom the motor vehicle is transferred with

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
The Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (4 of 1939), consolidates and amends the law relating to motor
vehicles. This has been amended several times to keep it up to date. The need was, however, felt that this
Act should, now inter aria, take into account also changes in the road transport technology, pattern of
passenger and freight movements, development of the road network in the country and particularly the
improve techniques in the motor vehicles management.
2. Various Committees like National Transport Policy Committee, National Police Commission, Road
Safety Committee, Low Powered Two-wheelers Committee, as also the Law Commission have gone into
different aspects of road transport. They have recommended updating, simplification and rationalization
of this law. Several Members of Parliament have also urged for comprehensive review of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1939, to make it relevant to the modern-day requirements.
3. A Working Group was, therefore, constituted in January, 1984 to review all the provisions of the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and to submit draft proposals for a comprehensive legislation to replace the
existing Act. This Working Group took into account the suggestions and recommendations earlier made
by various bodies and institutions like Central Institute of Road Transport Automotive Research
Association of India, and other transport organisations including the manufacturers and the general
public. Besides obtaining comments of State Governments on the recommendations of the Working
Group, these were discussed in a specially convened meeting of Transport Ministers of all States and
Union territories. Some of the more important modifications so suggested related for taking care of-
(a) the fast increasing number of both commercial vehicles and personal vehicles in the country;
(b) the need for encouraging adoption of higher technology in automotive sector;
(c) the greater flow of passenger and freight with the least impediments so that islands of isolations
are not created leading to regional or local imbalances;
(d) concern for road safety standards, and pollution-control measures, standards for transportation
of hazardous and explosive materials;
(e) simplification of procedure and policy liberalizations for private sector operations in the road
transport field; and
(f) need for effective ways of tracking down traffic offenders.
4. The Supreme Court in M. K. Kunhimohammed vs. P. A. Ahmedkutty, A.I.R. 1937 S.C. page 2158,
has made certain suggestions to raise the limit of compensation payable as a result of motor accidents is
respect of death and permanent disablement in the event of there being no proof of fault on the part of the
person involved in the accident and also in hit and run motor accidents and remove certain disparities in
the liability of the insurer to pay compensation depending upon the class or type of vehicles involved in
the accident. The above suggestions made by the Supreme Court have been incorporated in the Bill.
5. The proposed legislation has been prepared in the light of the above background. Some of the more
important provisions of the Bill provide for the following matters, namely:-
(a) rationalization of certain definitions with additions of certain new definitions of new types of
vehicles:
(b) stricter procedures relating to grant of driving licences and the period of validity thereof;
(c) laying down of standards for the components and parts of motor vehicles;
(d) standards for anti-pollution control devices;
(e) provision for issuing fitness certificates of vehicles also by the authorised testing stations;
(f) enabling provision for updating the system of registration marks;
(g) liberalised schemes for grant of stage carriage permits on non-nationalised routes, all-India
Tourist permits and also national permits for goods carriages;
(h) administration of the Solatium Scheme by the General Insurance Corporation;

entered into with no expectation of acquiring such an interest; or
(b) where the policy is made “interest or no interest”, or “without further proof of interest than the

thereto, or by the detention thereof, or may incur liability in respect thereof.
8. When interest must attach.-(1) The assured must be interested in the subject-matter insured at
the time of the loss, though he need not be interested when the insurance is effected:

(2) Where the assured has no interest at the time of the loss, he cannot acquire interest by any act or
election after he is aware of the loss.

interest.
(2) In particular, where the buyer of goods has insured them, he has an insurable interest,

seller’s risk, by reason of the latter’s delay in making delivery or otherwise.
10. Partial interest.-A partial interest of any nature is insurable.
11. Reinsurance.-(1) The insurer under a contract of marine insurance has an insurable interest in
his risk, and may reinsure in respect of it.

of the loan.
13. Master’s and seamen’s wages.-The master or any member of the crew of a ship has an
insurable interest in respect of his wages.

insurable interest, in so far as such freight is not repayable in case of loss.
15. Charges of insurance.-The assured has an insurable interest in the charges of any insurance
which he may effect.
16. Quantum of interest.-(1) Where the subject-matter insured is mortgaged, the mortgagor has an
insurable interest in the full value thereof, and the mortgagee has an insurable interest in respect of any
sum due or to become due under the mortgage.
(2) A mortgagee, consignee, or other person having an interest in the subject-matter insured may
insure on behalf and for the benefit of other persons interested as well as for his own benefit.
(3) The owner of insurable property has an insurable interest in respect of the full value thereof,
notwithstanding that some third person may have agreed, or be liable to indemnify him in case of loss.
17. Assignment of interest.-Where the assured assigns or otherwise parts with his interest in the
subject-matter insured, he does not thereby transfer to the assignee his rights under the contract of
insurance, unless there be an express or implied agreement with the assignee to that effect.
But the provisions of this section do not affect transmission of interest by operation of law.
INSURABLE VALUE
18. Measure of insurable value.-Subject to any express provision or valuation in the policy, the
insurable value of the subject-matter insured must be ascertained as follows:-
(1) In insurance on ship, the insurable value is the value, at the commencement of the risk, of the
ship, including her outfit, provisions, and stores for the officers and crew, money advanced for
seamen’s wages, and other disbursements (if any) incurred to make the ship fit for the voyage or
adventure contemplated by the policy, plus the charges of insurance upon the whole.
The insurable value, in the case of a steamship, includes also the machinery, boilers, and coals
and engine stores if owned by the assured; in the case of a ship driven by power other than steam
includes also the machinery and fuels and engine stores, if owned by the assured; and in the case of a
ship engaged in a special trade, includes also the ordinary fittings requisite for that trade.
(2) In insurance on freight, whether paid in advance or otherwise, the insurable value is the gross
amount of the freight at the risk of the assured, plus the charges of insurance.
(3) In insurance on goods or merchandise, the insurable value is the prime cost of the property
insured, plus the expenses of and incidental to shipping and the charges of insurance upon the whole.

assured when the policy attaches, plus the charges of insurance.
DISCLOSURE AND REPRESENTATIONS
19. Insurance is uberrimae fidei.-A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the
utmost good faith, and if the utmost good faith be not observed by either party, the contract may be
avoided by the other party.
20. Disclosure by assured.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the assured must disclose to
the insurer, before the contract is concluded, every material circumstance which, is known to the assured,
and the assured is deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to
be known to him. If the assured fails to make such disclosure, the insurer may avoid the contract.
(2) Every circumstance is material which would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing
the premium, or determining whether he will take the risk.
(3) In the absence of inquiry the following circumstances need not be disclosed, namely:-
(a) any circumstance which diminishes the risk;
(b) any circumstance which is known or presumed to be known to the insurer. The insurer is
presumed to know matters of common notoriety or knowledge, and matters which an insurer in the
ordinary course of his business as such ought to know;
(c) any circumstance as to which information is waived by the insurer;
(d) any circumstance which it is superfluous to disclose by reason of any express or implied
warranty.
(4) Whether any particular circumstance, which is not disclosed, be material or not is, in each case, a
question of fact.
(5) The term “circumstance” includes any communication made to, or information received by, the
assured.
21. Disclosure by agent effecting insurance.-Subject to the provisions of the preceding section as
to circumstances which need not be disclosed, where an insurance is effected for the assured by an agent,
the agent must disclose to the insurer-
(a) every material circumstance which is known to himself, and an agent to insure is deemed to
know every circumstance which in the ordinary course of business ought to be known by, or to have
been communicated to, him; and
(b) every material circumstance which the assured is bound to disclose, unless it comes to his
knowledge too late to communicate it to the agent.
22. Representations pending negotiation of contract.-(1) Every material representation made by
the assured or his agent to the insurer during the negotiations for the contract, and before the contract is
concluded, must be true. If it be untrue the insurer may avoid the contract.
(2) A representation is material which would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the
premium, or determining whether he will take the risk.
(3) A representation may be either as to a matter of fact, or as to a matter of expectation or belief.
(4) A representation as to a matter of fact is true, if it be substantially correct, that is to say, if the
difference between what is represented and what is actually correct would not be considered material by a
prudent insurer.
(5) A representation as to a matter of expectation or belief is true if it be made in good faith.
(6) A representation may be withdrawn or corrected before the contract is concluded.
(7) Whether a particular representation be material or not, is, in each case, a question of fact.
23. When contract is deemed to be concluded.-A contract of marine insurance is deemed to be
concluded when the proposal of the assured is accepted by the insurer, whether the policy be then issued
or not; and for the purpose of showing when the proposal was accepted, reference may be made to the
slip, covering note or other customary memorandum of the contract, although it be unstamped.
THE POLICY
24. Contract must be embodied in policy.-A contract of marine insurance shall not be admitted in
evidence unless it is embodied in a marine policy in accordance with this Act. The policy may be
executed and issued either at the time when the contract is concluded, or afterwards.
25. What policy must specify.-A marine policy must specify-
(1) the name of the assured, or of some person who effects the insurance on his behalf;
(2) the subject-matter insured and the risk insured against;
(3) the voyage, or period of time, or both, as the case may be, covered by the insurance;
(4) the sum or sums insured;
(5) the name or names of the insurer or insurers.
26. Signature of insurer.-(1) A marine policy must be signed by or on behalf of the insurer.
(2) Where a policy is subscribed by or on behalf of two or more insurers, each subscription, unless the
contrary be expressed, constitutes a distinct contract with the assured.
27. Voyage and time policies.-(1) Where the contract is to insure the subject-matter at and from, or
from one place to another or others, the policy is called a “voyage policy”, and, where the contract is to
insure the subject-matter for a definite period of time, the policy is called a “time policy”. A contract for
both voyage and time may be included in the same policy.
(2) A time policy which is made for any time exceeding twelve months is invalid.
28. Designation and subject-matter.-(1) The subject-matter insured must be designated in a
marine policy with reasonable certainty.
(2) The nature and extent of the interest of the assured in the subject-matter insured need not be
specified in the policy.
(3) Where the policy designates the subject-matter insured in general terms, it shall be construed to
apply to the interest intended by the assured to be covered.
(4) In the application of this section regard shall be had to any usage regulating the designation of the
subject-matter insured.
29. Valued policy.-(1) A policy may be either valued or unvalued.
(2) A valued policy is a policy which specifies the agreed value of the subject-matter insured.
(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, and in the absence of fraud, the value fixed by the policy is,
as between the insurer and assured, conclusive of the insurable value of the subject intended to be insured,
whether the loss be total or partial.
(4) Unless the policy otherwise provides, the value fixed by the policy is not conclusive for the
purpose of determining whether there has been a constructive total loss.
30. Unvalued policy.-An unvalued policy is a policy which does not specify the value of the
subject-matter insured, but subject to the limit of the sum insured, leaves the insurable value to be
subsequently ascertained, in the manner hereinbefore explained.
31. Floating policy by ship or ships.-(1) A floating policy is a policy which describes the insurance
in general terms, and leaves the name or names of the ship or ships and other particulars to be defined by
subsequent declaration.
(2) The subsequent declaration or declarations may be made by endorsement on the policy, or in other
customary manner.
(3) Unless the policy otherwise provides, the declarations must be made in the order of dispatch or
shipment. They must, in the case of goods, comprise all consignments within the terms of the policy, and
the value of the goods or other property must be honestly stated, but an omission or erroneous declaration
may be rectified even after loss or arrival, provided the omission or declaration was made in good faith.
(4) Unless the policy otherwise provides, where a declaration of value is not made until after notice of
loss or arrival, the policy must be treated as an unvalued policy as regards the subject-matter of that
declaration.
32. Construction of terms in policy.-(1) A policy may be in the form in the Schedule.
(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, and unless the context of the policy otherwise requires, the
terms and expressions mentioned in the Schedule shall be construed as having the scope and meaning
assigned to them in the Schedule.
33. Premium to be arranged.-(1) Where an insurance is effected at a premium to be arranged, and
no arrangement is made, a reasonable premium is payable.
(2) Where an insurance is effected on the terms that an additional premium is to be arranged in a
given event, and that event happens but no arrangement is made, then a reasonable additional premium is
payable.
DOUBLE INSURANCE
34. Double insurance.-(1) Where two or more policies are effected by or on behalf of the assured
on the same adventure and interest or any part thereof, and the sums insured exceed the indemnity
allowed by this Act, the assured is said to be over-insured by double insurance.
(2) Where the assured is over-insured by double insurance-
(a) the assured, unless the policy otherwise provides, may claim payment from the insurers in
such order as he may think fit, provided that he is not entitled to receive any sum in excess of the
indemnity allowed by this Act;
(b) where the policy under which the assured claims is a valued policy, the assured must give
credit as against the valuation, for any sum received by him under any other policy, without regard to
the actual value of the subject-matter insured;
(c) where the policy under which the assured claims is an unvalued policy he must give credit, as
against the full insurable value, for any sum received by him under any other policy;
(d) where the assured receives any sum in excess of the indemnity allowed by this Act, he is
deemed to hold such sum in trust for the insurers, according to their right of contribution among
themselves.
WARRANTIES, ETC.
35. Nature of warranty.-(1) A warranty, in the following sections relating to warranties, means a
promissory warranty, that is to say a warranty by which the assured undertakes that some particular thing
shall or shall not be done, or that some condition shall be fulfilled, or whereby he affirms or negatives the
existence of a particular state of facts.
(2) A warranty may be express or implied.
(3) A warranty, as above defined, is a condition which must be exactly complied with, whether it be
material to the risk or not. If it be not so complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the
policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of warranty, but without
prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.
36. When breach of warranty excused.-(1) Non-compliance with a warranty is excused when, by
reason of a change of circumstances, the warranty ceases to be applicable to the circumstances of the
contract, or when compliance with the warranty is rendered unlawful by any subsequent law.
(2) Where a warranty is broken, the assured cannot avail himself of the defence that the breach has
been remedied, and the warranty complied with before loss.
(3) A breach of warranty may be waived by the insurer.
37. Express warranties.-(1) An express warranty may be in any form of words from which the
intention to warrant is to be inferred.
(2) An express warranty must be included in, or written upon, the policy, or must be contained in
some document incorporated by reference into the policy.
(3) An express warranty does not exclude implied warranty, unless it be inconsistent therewith.
38. Warranty of neutrality.-(1) Where insurable property, whether ship or goods, is expressly
warranted neutral, there is an implied condition that the property shall have a neutral character at the
commencement of the risk, and that, so far as the assured can control the matter, its neutral character shall
be preserved during the risk.
(2) Where a ship is expressly warranted “neutral”, there is also an implied condition that, so far as the
assured can control the matter, she shall be properly documented, that is to say, that she shall carry the
necessary papers to establish her neutrality, and that she shall not falsify or suppress her papers, or use
simulated papers. If any loss occurs through breach of this condition, the insurer may avoid the contract.
39. No implied warranty of nationality.-There is no implied warranty as to the nationality of a
ship, or that her nationality shall not be changed during the risk.
40. Warranty of good safety.-Where the subject-matter insured is warranted “well” or “in good
safety” on a particular day, it is sufficient if it be safe at any time during that day.
41. Warranty of seaworthiness of ship.-(1) In a voyage policy there is an implied warranty that at
the commencement of the voyage the ship shall be seaworthy for the purpose of the particular adventure
insured.
(2) Where the policy attaches while the ship is in port, there is also an implied warranty that she shall,
at the commencement of the risk, be reasonably fit to encounter the ordinary perils of the port.
(3) Where the policy relates to a voyage which is performed in different stages, during which the ship
requires different kinds of or further preparation or equipment, there is an implied warranty that at the
commencement of each stage the ship is seaworthy in respect of such preparation or equipment for the
purposes of that stage.
(4) A ship is deemed to be seaworthy when she is reasonably fit in all respects to encounter the
ordinary perils of the seas of the adventure insured.
(5) In a time policy there is no implied warranty that the ship shall be seaworthy at any stage of the
adventure, but where, with the privity of the assured, the ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, the
insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to unseaworthiness.
42. No implied warranty that goods are seaworthy.-(1) In a policy on goods or other moveable
there is no implied warranty that the goods or movables are seaworthy.
(2) In a voyage policy on goods or other movables there is an implied warranty that at the
commencement of the voyage the ship is not only seaworthy as a ship, but also that she is reasonably fit
to carry the goods or other movables to the destination contemplated by the policy.
43. Warranty of legality.-There is an implied warranty that the adventure insured is a lawful one,
and that, so far as the assured can control the matter, the adventure shall be carried out in a lawful
manner.
THE VOYAGE
44. Implied condition as to commencement of risk.-(1) Where the subject-matter is insured by a
voyage policy “at and from” or “from” a particular place, it is not necessary that the ship should be at that
place when the contract is concluded, but there is an implied condition that the adventure shall be
commenced within a reasonable time, and that if the adventure be not so commenced the insurer may
avoid the contract.
(2) The implied condition may be negatived by showing that the delay was caused by circumstances
known to the insurer before the contract was concluded, or by showing that he waived the condition.
45. Alteration of port of departure.-Where the place of departure is specified by the policy, and
the ship instead of sailing from that place sails from any other place, the risk does not attach.
46. Sailing for different destination.-Where the destination is specified in the policy, and the ship,
instead of sailing for that destination, sails for any other destination, the risk does not attach.
47. Change of voyage.-(1) Where, after the commencement of the risk, the destination of the ship is
voluntarily changed from the destination contemplated by the policy, there is said to be a change of
voyage.
(2) Unless the policy otherwise provides, where there is a change of voyage, the insurer is discharged
from liability as from the time of change, that is to say, as from the time when the determination to
change it is manifested; and it is immaterial that the ship may not in fact have left the course of voyage
contemplated by the policy when the loss occurs.
48. Deviation.-(1) Where a ship, without lawful excused, deviates from the voyage contemplated by
the policy, the insured is discharged from liability as from the time of deviation, and it is immaterial that
the ship may have regained her route before any loss occurs.
(2) There is a deviation from the voyage contemplated by the policy-
(a) where the course of the voyage is specifically designated by the policy, and that course is
departed from; or
(b) where the course of the voyage is not specifically designated by the policy, but the usual and
customary course is departed from.
(3) The intention to deviate is immaterial; there must be a deviation in fact to discharge the insurer
from his liability under the contract.
49. Several ports of discharge.-(1) Where several ports of discharge are specified by the policy,
the ship may proceed to all or any of them, but, in the absence of any usage or sufficient cause to the
contrary, she must proceed to them, or such of them as she goes to, in the order designated by the policy.
If she does not, there is a deviation.
(2) Where the policy is to “ports of discharge”, within a given area, which are not named, the ship
must, in the absence of any usage or sufficient cause to the contrary, proceed to them, or such of them as
she goes to, in their geographical order. If she does not, there is a deviation.
50. Delay in voyage.-In the case of a voyage policy, the adventure insured must be prosecuted
throughout its course with reasonable dispatch, and, if without lawful excuse it is not so prosecuted, the
insurer is discharged from liability as from the time when the delay became unreasonable.
51. Excuse for deviation or delay.-(1) Deviation or delay in prosecuting the voyage contemplated
by the policy is excused-
(a) where authorised by any special term in the policy; or
(b) where caused by circumstances beyond the control of the master and his employer; or
(c) where reasonably necessary in order to comply with an express or implied warranty; or
(d) where reasonably necessary for the safety of the ship or subject-matter insured; or
(e) for the purpose of saving human life or aiding a ship in distress where human life may be in
danger; or
(f) where reasonably necessary for the purpose of obtaining medical or surgical aid for any person
on board the ship; or
(g) where caused by the barratrous conduct of the master or crew, if barratry be one of the perils
insured against.
(2) When the cause excusing the deviation or delay ceases to operate, the ship must resume her
course, and prosecute her voyage with reasonable dispatch.
ASSIGNMENT OF POLICY
52. When and how policy is assignable.-(1) A marine policy may be transferred by assignment
unless it contains terms expressly prohibiting assignment. It may be assigned either before or after loss.
(2) Where a marine policy has been assigned so as to pass the beneficial interest in such policy, the
assignee of the policy is entitled to sue thereon in his own name; and the defendant is entitled to make any
defence arising out of the contract which he would have been entitled to make if the suit had been brought
in the name of the person by or on behalf of whom the policy was effected.
(3) A marine policy may be assigned by endorsement thereon or in other customary manner.
53. Assured who has no interest cannot assign.-Where the assured has parted with or lost his
interest in the subject-matter insured, and has not, before or at the time of so doing expressly or impliedly
agreed to assign the policy, any subsequent assignment of the policy is inoperative:
Provided that nothing in this section affects the assignment of a policy after loss.
THE PREMIUM
54. When premium payable.-Unless otherwise agreed, the duty of the assured or his agent to pay
the premium, and the duty of the insurer to issue the policy to the assured or his agent, are concurrent
conditions, and the insurer is not bound to issue the policy until payment or tender of the premium.
LOSS AND ABANDONMENT
55. Included and excluded losses.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, and unless the policy
otherwise provides, the insurer is liable for any loss proximately caused by a peril insured against, but,
subject as aforesaid, he is not liable for any loss which is not proximately caused by a peril insured
against.
(2) In particular-
(a) the insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to the wilful misconduct of the assured, but,
unless the policy otherwise provides, he is liable for any loss proximately caused by a peril insured
against, even though the loss would not have happened but for the misconduct or negligence of the
master or crew;
(b) unless the policy otherwise provides, the insurer on ship or goods is not liable for any loss
proximately caused by delay, although the delay be caused by a peril insured against;
(c) unless the policy otherwise provides, the insurer is not liable for ordinary wear and tear,
ordinary leakage and breakage, inherent vice or nature of the subject-matter insured, or for any loss
proximately caused by rats or vermin, or for any injury to machinery not proximately caused by
maritime perils.
56. Partial and total loss.-(1) A loss may be either total or partial. Any loss other than a total loss,
as hereinafter defined, is a partial loss.
(2) A total loss may be either an actual total loss, or a constructive total loss.
(3) Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the policy, an insurance against total loss
includes a constructive, as well as an actual, total loss.
(4) Where the assured brings a suit for a total loss and the evidence proves only a partial loss, he may,
unless the policy otherwise provides, recover for a partial loss.
(5) Where goods reach their destination in specie, but by reason of obliteration of marks, or
otherwise, they are incapable of identification, the loss, if any, is partial and not total.
57. Actual total loss.-(1) Where the subject-matter insured is destroyed, or so damaged as to cease
to be a thing of the kind insured, or where the assured is irretrievably deprived thereof, there is an actual
total loss.
(2) In the case of an actual total loss no notice of abandonment need be given.
58. Missing ship.-Where the ship concerned in the adventure is missing, and after the lapse of a
reasonable time no news of her has been received, an actual total loss may be presumed.
59. Effect of transhipment, etc.-Where, by a peril insured against, the voyage is interrupted at
intermediate port or place, under such circumstances as, a part from any special stipulation in the contract
of a freightment, to justify the master in landing and reshipping the goods or other movables, or in
transhipping them, and sending them on to their destination, the liability of the insurer continues,
notwithstanding the landing or transhipment.
60. Constructive total loss defined.-(1) Subject to any express provision in the policy, there is a
constructive total loss where the subject-matter insured is reasonably abandoned on account of its actual
total loss appearing to be unavoidable, or because it could not be preserved from actual total loss without
an expenditure which would exceed its value when the expenditure had been incurred.
(2) In particular, there is a constructive total loss-
(i) where the assured is deprived of the possession of his ship or goods by a peril insured
against, and
(a) it is unlikely that he can recover the ship or goods, as the case may be, or
(b) the cost of recovering the ship or goods, as the case may be,
would exceed their value when recovered; or
(ii) in the case of damage to a ship, where she is so damaged by a peril insured against that the
cost of repairing the damage would exceed the value of the ship when repaired.
In estimating the cost of repairs, no deduction is to be made in respect of general average
contributions to those repairs payable by other interests, but account is to be taken of the expense of
future salvage operations and of any future general average contributions to which the ship would be
liable if required; or
(iii) In the case of damage to goods, where the cost of repairing the damage and forwarding the
goods to their destination would exceed their value on arrival.
61. Effect of constructive total loss.-Where there is a constructive total loss the assured may either
treat the loss as a partial loss, or abandon the subject-matter insured to the insurer and treat the loss as if it
were an actual total loss.
62. Notice of abandonment.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where the assured elects
to abandon the subject-matter insured to the insurer, he must give notice of abandonment. If he fails to do
so the loss can only be treated as a partial loss.
(2) Notice of abandonment may be given in writing, or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and
partly by word of mouth, and may be given in any terms which indicate the intention of the assured to
abandon his insured interest in the subject-matter insured unconditionally to the insurer.
(3) Notice of abandonment must be given with reasonable diligence after the receipt of reliable
information of the loss, but where the information is of a doubtful character the assured is entitled to a
reasonable time to make enquiry.
(4) Where notice of abandonment is properly given, the rights of the assured are not prejudiced by the
fact that the insurer refuses to accept the abandonment.
(5) The acceptance of an abandonment may be either express or implied from the conduct of the
insurer. The mere silence of the insurer after notice is not an acceptance.
(6) Where notice of abandonment is accepted the abandonment is irrevocable. The acceptance of the
notice conclusively admits liability for the loss and the sufficiency of the notice.
(7) Notice of abandonment is unnecessary where at the time when the assured receives information of
the loss, there would be no possibility of benefit to the insurer if notice were given to him.
(8) Notice of abandonment may be waived by the insurer.
(9) When an insurer has reinsured his risk, no notice of abandonment need be given by him.
63. Effect of abandonment.-(1) Where there is a valid abandonment the insurer is entitled to take
over the interest of the assured in whatever may remain of the subject-matter insured, and all proprietary
rights incidental thereto.
(2) Upon the abandonment of a ship, the insurer thereof is entitled to any freight in course of being
earned, and which is earned by her subsequent to the casualty causing the loss, less the expenses of
earning it incurred after the casualty; and, where the ship is carrying the owner’s goods, the insurer is
entitled to a reasonable remuneration for the carriage of them subsequent to the casualty causing the loss.
PARTIAL LOSSES (INCLUDING SALVAGE AND GENERAL AVERAGE AND PARTICULAR CHARGES)
64. Particular average loss.-(1) A particular average loss is a partial loss of the subject-matter
insured, caused by a peril insured against, and which is not a general average loss.
(2) Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the assured for the safety or preservation of the
subject-matter insured, other than general average and salvage charges, are called particular charges.
Particularly charges are not included in particular average.
65. Salvage charges.-(1) Subject to any express provision in the policy, salvage charges incurred in
preventing a loss by perils insured against may be recovered as a loss by those perils.
(2) “Salvage charges” means the charges recoverable under maritime law by a salvor independently
of contract. They do not include the expenses of services in the nature of salvage rendered by the assured
or his agents, or any person employed for hire by them, for the purpose of averting a peril insured against.
Such expenses, where properly incurred, may be recovered as particular charges or as a general average
loss, according to the circumstances under which they were incurred.
66. General average loss.-(1) A general average loss is a loss caused by or directly consequential
on a general average act. It includes a general average expenditure as well as a general average sacrifice.
(2) There is a general average act where any extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure is voluntarily and
reasonably made or incurred in time of peril for the purpose of preserving the property imperilled in the
common adventure.
(3) Where there is a general average loss, the party on whom it falls is entitled, subject to the
conditions imposed by maritime law, to a rateable contribution from the other parties interested, and such
contribution is called a general average contribution.
(4) Subject to any express provision in the policy, where the assured has incurred a general average or
expenditure, he may recover from the insurer in respect of the proportion of the loss which falls upon
him; and in the case of a general average sacrifice, he may recover from the insurer in respect of the
whole loss without having enforced his right of contribution from the other parties liable to contribute.
(5) Subject to any express provision in the policy, where the assured has paid, or is liable to pay, a
general average contribution in respect of the interest insured, he may recover therefor from the insurer.
(6) In the absence of express stipulation, the insurer is not liable for any general average loss or
contribution where the loss was not incurred for the purpose of avoiding, or in connection with the
avoidance of a peril insured against.
(7) Where ship, freight, and cargo, or any two of those interests, are owned by the same assured, the
liability of the insurer in respect of general average losses or contributions is to be determined as if those
interests were owned by different persons.
MEASURE OF INDEMNITY
67. Extent of liability of insurer for loss.-(1) The sum which the assured can recover in respect of
a loss on a policy by which he is insured, in the case of an unvalued policy to the full extent of the
insurable value, or, in the case of a valued policy to the full extent of the value fixed by the policy, is
called the measure of indemnity.
(2) Where there is a loss recoverable under the policy, the insurer, or each insurer if there be more
than one, is liable for such proportion of the measure of indemnity as the amount of his subscription bears
to the value fixed by the policy in the case of a valued policy, or to the insurable value in the case of an
unvalued policy.
68. Total loss.-Subject to the provisions of this Act, and to any express provision in the policy,
where there is a total loss of the subject-matter insured-
(1) if the policy be a valued policy, the measure of indemnity is the sum fixed by the policy;
(2) if the policy be an unvalued policy, the measure of indemnity is the insurable value of the
subject-matter insured.
69. Partial loss of ship.-Where a ship is damaged, but is not totally lost, the measure of indemnity
subject to any express provision in the policy, is as follows-
(1) where the ship has been repaired, the assured is entitled to the reasonable cost of the repairs,
less the customary deductions, but not exceeding the sum insured in respect of any one casualty;
(2) where the ship has been only partially repaired, the assured is entitled to the reasonable cost of
such repairs, computed as above, and also to be indemnified for the reasonable depreciation, if any,
arising from the unrepaired damage, provided that the aggregate amount shall not exceed the cost of
repairing the whole damage, computed as above;
(3) where the ship has not been repaired, and has not been sold in her damaged state during the
risk, the assured is entitled to be indemnified for the reasonable depreciation arising from the
unrepaired damage, but not exceeding the reasonable cost of repairing such damage, computed as
above;
(4) where the ship has not been repaired, and has been sold in her damaged state during the risk,
the assured is entitled to be indemnified for the reasonable cost of repairing the damage, computed as
above, but not exceeding the depreciation in value as ascertained by the sale.
70. Partial loss of freight.-Subject to any express provision in the policy, where there is a partial
loss of freight, the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed by the policy in the case of a
valued policy or of the insurable value in the case of an unvalued policy, as the proportion of freight lost
by the assured bears to the whole freight at the risk of the assured under the policy.
71. Partial loss of goods, merchandise, etc.-Where there is a partial loss of goods, merchandise, or
other movable, the measure of indemnity, subject to any express provision in the policy, is as follows:-
(1) where part of the goods, merchandise or other movable insured by a valued policy is totally
lost, the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed by the policy as the insurable value
of the part lost bears to the insurable value of the whole, ascertained as in the case of an unvalued
policy;
(2) where part of the goods, merchandise or other movable insured by an unvalued policy is
totally lost, the measure of indemnity is the insurable value of the part lost, ascertained as in case of
total loss;
(3) where the whole or any part of the goods or merchandise insured has been delivered damaged
at its destination, the measure of idemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed by the policy in the
case of a valued policy, or of the insurable value in the case of an unvalued policy, as the difference
between the gross sound and damaged values at the place of arrival bears to the gross sound value;
(4) “Gross value” means the wholesale price, or, if there be no such price, the estimated value,
with, in either case, freight, landing charges, and duty paid beforehand; provided that, in the case of
goods or merchandise customarily sold in bond, the bonded price is deemed to be the gross value.
“Gross proceeds” means the actual price obtained at a sale where all charges on sale are paid by the
sellers.
72. Apportionment of valuation.-(1) Where different species of property are insured under a single
valuation, the valuation must be apportioned over the different species in proportion to their respective
insurable values, as in the case of an unvalued policy. The insured value of any part of a species is such
proportion of the total insured value of the same as the insurable value of the part bears to the insurable
value of the whole, ascertained in both cases as provided by this Act.
(2) Where a valuation has to be apportioned, and particulars of the prime cost of each separate
species, quality, or description of goods cannot be ascertained, the division of the valuation may be made
over the net arrived sound values of the different species, qualities, or descriptions of goods.
73. General average contributions and salvage charges.-(1) Subject to any express provision in
the policy, where the assured has paid, or is liable for, any general average contribution, the measure of
indemnity is the full amount of such contribution if the subject-matter liable to contribution is insured for
its full contributory value; but, if such subject-matter be not insured for its full contributory value, or if
only part of it be insured, the indemnity payable by the insurer must be reduced in proportion to the
under-insurance, and where there has been a particular average loss which constitutes a deduction from
the contributory value, and for which the insurer is liable, that amount must be deducted from the insured
value in order to ascertain what the insurer is liable to contribute.
(2) Where the insurer is liable for salvage charges the extent of his liabilities must be determined on
the like principle.
74. Liabilities to third parties.-Where the assured has effected an insurance in express terms
against any liability to a third party, the measure of indemnity, subject to any express provision in the
policy, is the amount paid or payable by him to such third party in respect of such liability.
75. General provisions as to measure of indemnity.-(1) Where there has been a loss in respect of
any subject-matter not expressly provided for in the foregoing provisions of this Act, the measure of
indemnity shall be ascertained as nearly as may be, in accordance with those provisions, in so far as
applicable to the particular case.
(2) Nothing in the provisions of this Act relating to the measure of indemnity shall affect the rules
relating to double insurance, or prohibit the insurer from disproving interest wholly or in part, or from
showing that at the time of the loss the whole or any part of the subject-matter insured was not at risk
under the policy.
76. Particular average warranties.-(1) Where the subject-matter insured is warranted free from
particular average, the assured cannot recover for a loss of part, other than a loss incurred by a general
average sacrifice, unless the contract contained in the policy be apportionable; but, if the contract be
apportionable, the assured may recover for a total loss of any apportionable part.
(2) Where the subject-matter insured is warranted free from particular average, either wholly or under
a certain percentage, the insurer is nevertheless liable for salvage charges, and for particular charges and
other expenses properly incurred pursuant to the provisions of the suing and labouring clause in order to
avert a loss insured against.
(3) Unless the policy otherwise provides, where the subject-matter insured is warranted free from
particular average under a specified percentage, a general average loss cannot be added to a particular
average loss to make up the specified percentage.
(4) For the purpose of ascertaining whether the specified percentage has been reached, regard shall be
had only to the actual loss suffered by the subject-matter insured. Particular charges and the expenses of
and incidental to ascertaining and proving the loss must be excluded.
77. Successive losses.-(1) Unless the policy otherwise provides, and subject to the provisions of this
Act, the insurer is liable for successive losses, even though the total amount of such losses may exceed the
sum insured.
(2) Where, under the same policy, a partial loss, which has not been repaired or otherwise made good,
is followed by a total loss, the assured can only recover in respect of the total loss:
Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the liability of the insurer under the suing and
labouring clause.
78. Suing and labouring clause.-(1) Where the policy contains a suing and labouring clause, the
engagement thereby entered into is deemed to be supplementary to the contract of insurance, and the
assured may recover from the insurer any expenses properly incurred pursuant to the clause,
notwithstanding that the insurer may have paid for a total loss, or that the subject-matter may have been
warranted free from particular average, either wholly or under a certain percentage.
(2) General average losses and contributions and salvage charges, as defined by this Act, are not
recoverable under the suing and labouring clause.
(3) Expenses incurred for the purpose of averting or diminishing any loss not covered by the policy
are not recoverable under the suing and labouring clause.
(4) It is the duty of the assured and his agents, in all cases, to take such measures as may be
reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimising a loss.
RIGHTS OF INSURER ON PAYMENTS
79. Right of subrogation.-(1) Where the insurer pays for a total loss, either of the whole, or in the
case of goods of any apportionable part, of the subject-matter insured, he thereupon becomes entitled to
take over the interest of the assured in whatever may remain of the subject-matter so paid for, and he is
thereby subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the assured in and in respect of that subject-matter as
from the time of the casualty causing the loss.
(2) Subject to the foregoing provisions, where the insurer pays for a partial loss, he acquires no title to
the subject-matter insured, or such part of it as may remain, but he is thereupon subrogated to all rights
and remedies of the assured in and in respect of the subject-matter insured as from the time of the casualty
causing the loss, in so far as the assured has been indemnified, according to this Act, by such payment for
the loss.
80. Right of contribution.-(1) Where the assured is over-insured by double insurance, each insurer
is bound, as between himself and the other insurers, to contribute rateably to the loss in proportion to the
amount for which he is liable under his contract.
(2) If any insurer pays more than his proportion of the loss, he is entitled to maintain a suit for
contribution against the other insurers, and is entitled to the like remedies as a surety who has paid more
than his proportion of the debt.
81. Effect of under-insurance.-Where the assured is insured for an amount less than the insurable
value, or, in the case of a valued policy, for an amount less than the policy valuation, he is deemed to be
his own insurer in respect of the uninsured balance.
RETURN OF PREMIUM
82. Enforcement of return.-Where the premium, or a proportionate part thereof, is, by this Act,
declared to be returnable-
(a) if already paid, it may be recovered by the assured from the insurer, and,
(b) if unpaid, it may be retained by the assured or his agent.
83. Return by agreement.-Where the policy contains a stipulation for the return of the premium, or
a proportionate part thereof, on the happening of a certain event, and that event happens, the premium, or,
as the case may be, the proportionate part thereof, is thereupon returnable to the assured.
84. Return for failure of consideration.-(1) Where the consideration for the payment of the
premium totally fails, and there has been no fraud or illegality on the part of the assured or his agents, the
premium is thereupon returnable to the assured.
(2) Where the consideration for the payment of the premium is apportionable and there is a total
failure of any apportionable part of the consideration, a proportionate part of the premium is, under the
like conditions, thereupon returnable to the assured.
(3) In particular:-
(a) where the policy is void, or is avoided by the insurer as from the commencement of the risk,
the premium is returnable, provided there has been no fraud or illegality on the part of the assured;
but if the risk is not apportionable, and has once attached, the premium is not returnable;
(b) where the subject-matter insured, or part thereof, has never been inperilled the premium, or, as
the case may be, a proportionate part thereof, is returnable:
Provided that where the subject-matter has been insured “lost or not lost”, and has arrived in
safety at the time when the contract is concluded, the premium is not returnable unless, at such time,
the insurer knew of the safe arrival;
(c) where the assured has no insurable interest throughout the currency of the risk the premium is
returnable, provided that the rule does not apply to a policy effected by way of wagering;
(d) where the assured has a defeasible interest which is terminated during the currency of the risk,
the premium is not returnable;

RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY
The following are the rules referred to by this Act for the construction of a policy in the above or
other like form, where the context does not otherwise require:-
1. Lost and not lost.-Where the subject-matter is insured “lost or not lost” and the loss has occurred
before the contract is concluded, the risk attaches unless, at such time the assured was aware of the loss,
and the insurer was not.
2. From.-Where the subject-matter is insured “from” a particular place, the risk does not attach until
the ship starts on the voyage insured.
3. At and from.-(a) Where a ship is insured “at and from” a particular place, and she is at that place
in good safety when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately.
(b) If she be not at that place when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives
there in good safety, and, unless the policy otherwise provides, it is immaterial that she is covered by
another policy for a specified time after arrival.
(c) Where chartered freight is insured “at and from” a particular place, and the ship is at that place in
good safety when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately. If she be not there when the
contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in good safety.
(d) Where freight, other than chartered freight, is payable without special conditions and is insured “at
and from” a particular place, the risk attaches pro rata as the goods or merchandise are shipped; provided
that if there be cargo in readiness which belongs to the ship-owner, or which some other person has
contracted with him to ship, the risk attaches as soon as the ship is ready to receive such cargo.
4. From the loading thereof.-Where goods or other movables are insured “from the loading
thereof”, the risk does not attach until such goods or movables are actually on board, and the insurer is not
liable for them while in transit from the shore to the ship.
5. Safely landed.-Where the risk on goods or other movables continues until they are “safely
landed”, they must be landed in the customary manner and within a reasonable time after arrival at the
port of discharge, and if they are not so landed the risk ceases.
6. Touch and stay.-In the absence of any further license or usage, the liberty to touch and stay “at
any port or place whatsoever” does not authorise the ship to depart from the course of her voyage from
the port of departure to the port of destination.
7. Perils of the seas.-The term “perils of the seas” refers only to fortuitous accidents or casualties of
the seas. It does not include the ordinary action of the winds and waves.
8. Pirates.-The term “pirates” includes passengers who mutiny and rioters who attack the ship from
the shore.
9. Thieves.-The term “thieves” does not cover clandestine theft or a theft committed by any one of
the ship’s company, whether crew or passengers.
10. Restraint of Princes.-The term “arrests, etc., of kings, princes, and people” refers to political or
executive acts, and does not include a loss caused by riot or by ordinary judicial process.
11. Barratry.-The term “barratry” includes every wrongful act wilfully committed by the master of
crew to the prejudice of the owner, or, as the case may be, the charterer.
12. All other perils.-The term “all other perils” includes only perils similar in kind to the perils
specifically mentioned in the policy.
13. Average unless general.-The term “average unless general” means a partial loss of the
subject-matter insured other than a general average loss, and does not include “particular charges”.
14. Stranded.-Where the ship has stranded, the insurer is liable for the excepted losses although the
loss is not attributable to the stranding, provided that when the standing takes place the risk has attached
and, if the policy be on goods, that the damaged goods are on board.
15. Ship.-The term “ship” includes the hull, material and outfit, stores and provisions for the
officers and crew, and, in the case of vessels engaged in a special trade, the ordinary fittings requisite for
the trade, and also, in the case of a steamship, the machinery, boilers, and coals and engine stores, if
owned by the assured and also in the case of a ship driven by power other than steam, the machinery and
fuels and engine stores, if owned by the assured.
16. Freight.-The term “freight” includes the profit derivable by a ship-owner from the employment
of his ship to carry his own goods or movables as well as freight payable by a third party, but does not
include passage money.
17. Goods.-The term “goods” means goods in the nature of merchandise, and does not include
personal effects or provisions and stores for use on board.
In the absence of any usage to the contrary, deck cargo and living animals must be insured
specifically, and not under the general denomination of goods.
